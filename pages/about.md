# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am a versatile software developer with a background in video game development and audio programming. I thrive in complex problem-solving environments and excel in collaborative pair programming tasks. My expertise spans engine development, software design patterns, and 3D math, with a strong command of C/C++ and data structures. I have a rich history of working on diverse projects, including InfeStation, Mirage, and 9 To Fright, where I contributed as an audio programmer and collaborated closely with multi-disciplinary teams. Additionally, I have a keen interest in event planning, supporting student initiatives, and managing projects with Agile Development methodologies.
